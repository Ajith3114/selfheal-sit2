"""
Auto-fix agent for the Self-Healing Deploy pipeline.

When a deploy fails, this reads the real failure log, asks a model on Amazon
Bedrock for a corrected index.html, checks that answer with the very same
script the pipeline uses, and only then opens a pull request.

This is deliberately NOT an autonomous agent. The model gets exactly one turn
and returns exactly one thing: the full text of a fixed index.html. Every
decision that actually matters -- is this even a code problem, is the fix
valid, does a PR get opened -- is made down here in plain Python you can read
top to bottom.

That split is the point. The model is allowed to be wrong. check-html.py is
what decides whether its answer gets anywhere near production.

Any Bedrock model that supports the Converse API works here. Nothing in this
file is tied to a particular model vendor.
